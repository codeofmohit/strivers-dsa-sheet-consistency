A community driven repo for practising striver's DSA sheet, consistently. Target to complete the sheet or at least attempt each problem in next 180 days.

[Striver A@Z DSA Sheet Link (click here!) ](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)

- 🚀 Start date : 23 May 2024
- 🎯 Probable End Date : 23 November 2024 [or before it]

## ⧴ Rules (follow these) ⬇️

### 1. Personalization 🔥

- each user of the repo will work on their own branches, their own named branches, for example, Mohit Verma can have their branch as mohit-verma.

### 2. Consistency is the key 🔥

- everyday every user must solve one problem out of striver dsa sheet, if not able to solve the problem, its completely fine but at least an attempt of solving that problem must be there everyday.

- after the solution of a days problem or after the attempt, the solution/attempt must be committed to their respective branches. [commit format -> day-1-of-180-23-may-2024]

- we all fail at things often, and failing is completley okay, although we all will try to practise the dsa sheet questions everyday, sometimes we might not be able to do so, for health/personal reasons, it is okay to take breaks, if any user is taking a break, he/she must add a break commit such as [ 4-days-of-break-from-25-may-2024-to-28-may-2024]

- by allowing breaks in this journey we are encourging all users to finish the sheet or at least attempt all the given priblem, which is more important that few days setback (breaks)

### 3. Accountability 🔥

- on every sunday, one person out of the community will check who among the members have not submitted/committed the daily problem solution/attempt, and will message the person on linkedin (links below) asking the reason. So that we all can be accountable to do this everyday for next 6 months.
